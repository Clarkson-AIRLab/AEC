# AEC
AEC is an aerosol efficiency calculator that uses empirical equations to estimate the particle sampling efficiency for different sizes in a sampling system.
I created AEC for my M.S. thesis, it is still not the final version we want, but you can use this tool or some of the functions in the AEC to do an empirical estimations of particle transmission efficiency under you particle sampling systmes, espicially in different tubes.
Notice that:
1. The folder contains all the matlab files you need for running the AEC function.
2. The pdf file "AEC.pdf" gives you examples and tutorial of how to use AEC correctly.
3. AEC is created based on the paper "Particle Loss Calculatorâ€“a new software tool for the assessment of the performance of aerosol inlet systems" and you can also search my M.S. thesis "Aerosol Efficiency Calculator (AEC): a system-of-systems approach to calculate aerosol sampling efficiencies of complex sampling systems" for more details of AEC and how to use it.
